# 443. String Compression

>Medium

Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of **consecutive repeating characters** in `chars`:

	* If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.

	* Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` **should not be returned separately**, but instead, be stored **in the input character array `chars`**. Note that group lengths that are `10` or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done **modifying the input array,** return *the new length of the array*.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

**Note:** The characters in the array beyond the returned length do not matter and should be ignored.

**Example 1:**

>Input: chars = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;c&quot;] \
>Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;3&quot;] \
>Explanation: The groups are &quot;aa&quot;, &quot;bb&quot;, and &quot;ccc&quot;. This compresses to &quot;a2b2c3&quot;.

**Example 2:**

>Input: chars = [&quot;a&quot;] \
>Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: [&quot;a&quot;] \
>Explanation: The only group is &quot;a&quot;, which remains uncompressed since it&#39;s a single character.

**Example 3:**

>Input: chars = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] \
>Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;]. \
>Explanation: The groups are &quot;a&quot; and &quot;bbbbbbbbbbbb&quot;. This compresses to &quot;ab12&quot;.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= chars.length <= 2000`
* `chars[i]` is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.
