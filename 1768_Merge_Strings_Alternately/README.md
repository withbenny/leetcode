# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately

>Easy

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.



Return *the merged string.*

**Example 1:**

>Input: word1 = &quot;abc&quot;, word2 = &quot;pqr&quot; \
>Output: &quot;apbqcr&quot; \
>Explanation:&nbsp;The merged string will be merged as so: \
>word1:  a   b   c \
>word2:    p   q   r \
>merged: a p b q c r

**Example 2:**

>Input: word1 = &quot;ab&quot;, word2 = &quot;pqrs&quot; \
>Output: &quot;apbqrs&quot; \
>Explanation:&nbsp;Notice that as word2 is longer, &quot;rs&quot; is appended to the end. \
>word1:  a   b \
>word2:    p   q   r   s \
>merged: a p b q   r   s

**Example 3:**

>Input: word1 = &quot;abcd&quot;, word2 = &quot;pq&quot; \
>Output: &quot;apbqcd&quot; \
>Explanation:&nbsp;Notice that as word1 is longer, &quot;cd&quot; is appended to the end. \
>word1:  a   b   c   d \
>word2:    p   q \
>merged: a p b q c   d

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
* `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.
