# 1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close

>Medium

Two strings are considered **close** if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

	* Operation 1: Swap any two **existing** characters.

	

		* For example, `abcde -> aecdb`

	

	

	* Operation 2: Transform **every** occurrence of one **existing** character into another **existing** character, and do the same with the other character.
	

		* For example, `aacabb -> bbcbaa` (all `a`'s turn into `b`'s, and all `b`'s turn into `a`'s)

	

	

You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Given two strings, `word1` and `word2`, return `true`* if *`word1`* and *`word2`* are **close**, and *`false`* otherwise.*

**Example 1:**

>Input: word1 = &quot;abc&quot;, word2 = &quot;bca&quot; \
>Output: true \
>Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 2 operations. \
>Apply Operation 1: &quot;abc&quot; -&gt; &quot;acb&quot; \
>Apply Operation 1: &quot;acb&quot; -&gt; &quot;bca&quot;

**Example 2:**

>Input: word1 = &quot;a&quot;, word2 = &quot;aa&quot; \
>Output: false \
>Explanation: It is impossible to attain word2 from word1, or vice versa, in any number of operations.

**Example 3:**

>Input: word1 = &quot;cabbba&quot;, word2 = &quot;abbccc&quot; \
>Output: true \
>Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 3 operations. \
>Apply Operation 1: &quot;cabbba&quot; -&gt; &quot;caabbb&quot; \
>Apply Operation 2: &quot;caabbb&quot; -&gt; &quot;baaccc&quot; \
>Apply Operation 2: &quot;baaccc&quot; -&gt; &quot;abbccc&quot;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 10^5`
* `word1` and `word2` contain only lowercase English letters.
