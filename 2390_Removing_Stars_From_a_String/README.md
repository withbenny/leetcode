# 2390. Removing Stars From a String

>Medium

You are given a string `s`, which contains stars `*`.

In one operation, you can:

	* Choose a star in `s`.

	* Remove the closest **non-star** character to its **left**, as well as remove the star itself.

Return *the string after **all** stars have been removed*.

**Note:**

	* The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.

	* It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.

**Example 1:**

>Input: s = &quot;leet**cod*e&quot; \
>Output: &quot;lecoe&quot; \
>Explanation: Performing the removals from left to right: \
>- The closest character to the 1st star is &#39;t&#39; in &quot;leet**cod*e&quot;. s becomes &quot;lee*cod*e&quot;.
>- The closest character to the 2nd star is &#39;e&#39; in &quot;lee*cod*e&quot;. s becomes &quot;lecod*e&quot;.
>- The closest character to the 3rd star is &#39;d&#39; in &quot;lecod*e&quot;. s becomes &quot;lecoe&quot;.
>There are no more stars, so we return &quot;lecoe&quot;.

**Example 2:**

>Input: s = &quot;erase*****&quot; \
>Output: &quot;&quot; \
>Explanation: The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters and stars `*`.
* The operation above can be performed on `s`.
