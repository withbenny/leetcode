# 8. String to Integer (atoi)

>Medium

Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

	* **Whitespace**: Ignore any leading whitespace (`" "`).

	* **Signedness**: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is `'-'` or `'+'`, assuming positivity if neither present.

	* **Conversion**: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.

	* **Rounding**: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`, then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-2^31` should be rounded to `-2^31`, and integers greater than `2^31 - 1` should be rounded to `2^31 - 1`.

Return the integer as the final result.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** s = "42" \
>**Output:** 42 \
>**Explanation:** \
>The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position. \
>Step 1: &quot;42&quot; (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace) \
>^ \
>Step 2: &quot;42&quot; (no characters read because there is neither a &#39;-&#39; nor &#39;+&#39;) \
>^ \
>Step 3: &quot;42&quot; (&quot;42&quot; is read in) \
>^

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** s = " -042" \
>**Output:** -42 \
>**Explanation:** \
>Step 1: &quot;   -042&quot; (leading whitespace is read and ignored) \
>^ \
>Step 2: &quot;   -042&quot; (&#39;-&#39; is read, so the result should be negative) \
>^ \
>Step 3: &quot;   -042&quot; (&quot;042&quot; is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result) \
>^

**Example 3:**

>**Input:** s = "1337c0d3" \
>**Output:** 1337 \
>**Explanation:** \
>Step 1: &quot;1337c0d3&quot; (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace) \
>^ \
>Step 2: &quot;1337c0d3&quot; (no characters read because there is neither a &#39;-&#39; nor &#39;+&#39;) \
>^ \
>Step 3: &quot;1337c0d3&quot; (&quot;1337&quot; is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit) \
>^

**Example 4:**

>**Input:** s = "0-1" \
>**Output:** 0 \
>**Explanation:** \
>Step 1: &quot;0-1&quot; (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace) \
>^ \
>Step 2: &quot;0-1&quot; (no characters read because there is neither a &#39;-&#39; nor &#39;+&#39;) \
>^ \
>Step 3: &quot;0-1&quot; (&quot;0&quot; is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit) \
>^

**Example 5:**

>**Input:** s = "words and 987" \
>**Output:** 0 \
>**Explanation:** \
>Reading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= s.length <= 200`
* `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`0-9`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.
